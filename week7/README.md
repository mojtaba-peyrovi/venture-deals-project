## VENTURE DEALS
 ---

 ### Week 7:
 
 #### Acquisition:
 
 __LOI(Letter of Intent):__ Letter of Intent is something similar to term sheet, in case there is a buyer for the business and we want to sell the whole company to them.
 
 Sometimes it's not that easy to figure out how much money you will get exactly out of the deal, because there are different components involved in it, such as earn out that we get earned later, or some amount of money that is held back for a period of time.
 
Some companies are acquired on cash, but some can be offered stock in the buyer company.

__Stock Deals:__ When the buyer buys the whole company or 100% of the company stock. So the first company will be a part of the second company.

__Asset Deals:__ It happens when a buyer buys specific assets of a company. It means that the company itself still exists, but just sold some assets.

`Buyers mostly prefer to go for asset deals instead of stock deals, for two reasons"

1) Liabilities: the buyer can pick the asset they want and leave some with liabilities behind.

2) the perception that asset deals are easier that stock deals, which could have been correct at some periods of time in the past but not anymore.`

Nowadays, vc's have realised that buying the whole company is much cleaner rather than buying some assets, so `recently investors try to make a stock deal to have the whole company acquired.`

__Form of Consideration:__ How the company prefers to be paid? cash is well known, but stock can be tricky because if they say we will give you shares of our company for 50M USD, it depends on how the company performs in the future, or how the company has evaluated themselves, because their self-evaluation could be inappropriate.

If a private company wants to acquire you, you should access all their financial documents to analyze how they are doing, how much cash they have. also they should provide another thing called 409a evaluation which is the analysis of their different classes of stock including common stock. sometimes companies keep their 409a evaluation purposely low for tax reasons.`  
 
 
__Assumption of Stuck Options:__ It explains how the acquisition will affect employees' stock (stock options). 

A lot of times when the sale of the company is below the liquidation preference, the investors will get all of the money and the stock options won't have any value.

__Representations, Warranties, and Indemnifications(جبران خسارت):__

Reps and warranties, are the things the company owners claim they are true about the company. They will be reflected in LOI, because we are trying to define what to show by the __Escrow__ versus which one is going to be outside the escrow. some examples of rep, is we are going to rep that the capital structure of the company is true, or rep that the intellectual properties are all owned by the company. or another rep that you show all legal cases that you know the company is dealing with.

The indemnification, is an statement that says if one of the reps and warranties mentioned are not true, the seller will be responsible for them.

__Escrow or Holdback:__ It is the amount of the consideration, to be heldback as a guarantee to any breaches in representations and warranties. 
```
A typical amount for an escrow is something between %10-%20 and it will be held for 1-2 years.
```
There will be an escrow account and the escrow money will be sitting there, until the escrow time over.

The escrow usually is held by a third party, but not always.

__Confidentiality Agreement (NDA):__

In almost any acquisition case, the buyers will insist on having a mutual NDA, which means whatever you tell them, they must keep it secret and vice versa.

__Employees and Acquisition:__ Often, the investors like the C level to sign contracts with them and keep working at the new company.

In case of lower level employees, usually the investor doesn't focus on every single employee to sign a new contract.

The norm for the entrepreneur to let his employees know about the future of the deal, is some key employees may get more info later in the process before the deal is signed, than others.

__Conditions to close:__ These are some words that the buyer will try to put in LOI, in order to have some ways to get out of the deal, if the don't want to move forward. 

__No Shop Clause:__ It says for sometimes between 30-60 days or sometimes 90, you are not allow to shop you company to any other acquirer. Or you are not going to talk to any potential buyer during this period of time.

It is important to have a good lawyer involved for the whole process ins critical, because you want to make sure you get the best deal signed. 

The low end of the lawyer costs in the US, is between 25k-50k USD. Meduim rate is 50k-100k, and for large acquisitions, it might cost 500k.

The most usual way, is the buyers pay for their own share of lawyers involved, and the seller will pay for their own.
