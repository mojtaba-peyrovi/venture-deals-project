 ### Week 3:
 
 __Cap Table:__ The capitalization table (cap table) lays out the economic aspects of a company's ownership structure, including the number of shares held by the various parties, the percentage of the company those shares represent, the total number of outstanding shares in each class and the number of shares reserved for the employee stock pool.
 
 It simply says, who own how many percents, who has the vote right, who gets paid what, how much power each shareholder has.
 
 The lawyers of the vc normally take care of this part, they make sure everything with the cap table is correct, then certify to the vc that the cap table is correct.
 
  __Two important monetary aspects vc's have to take care of:__
  
 1- Investing in companies
 
 2- Paying salaries for the management
 
 Hwo they will be able to generate this cash? 
 
 1- By collecting funds from the investors
 
 2- Selling companies and use the income as a re-investment source.
 
 - vc's DO NOT use all of their funds for investing, because they must be ready for any upcoming expenses and situations. Therefore, they may use around 85% of the funds and keep 15% for backup.
 
 __What is convertible debt?__
 
Entrepreneurs today have two options when it comes to raising money to fund their company, __debt__ or __equity__. 

Debt is a loan which they must pay back within an agreed upon amount of time, with interest. 

Equity, instead, means they are providing a portion of ownership of their company in exchange for the investment.

Convertible debt, issued through a __convertible note__, is advantageous to founders because it allows the founder to 
- delay giving up a portion of his/her company. 
- delay setting a valuation for the company.

__Cap:__ A cap is a maximum valuation on the company wherein the investor agrees to convert his/her sharesâ€”from debt to equity.

Caps are used to protect early investors in case the value of the company skyrockets in the next financing round, the investor will get to convert their investment at the cap rate.


##### How the conversion happens?

There are two ways of conversion:

1) __Automatic Conversion:__ It happens after something is happening and triggering the conversion. Like after a certain amount of financing, or after certain amount of time passes. 

2) __Voluntary Conversion:__ Happens when the terms of the automatic conversion aren't satisfied. When the business needs more capital in the early stages, the vc won't call the note because it deons't usually bring their funds back. In this cases they try to compromise or extend the period. 

In most of cases, old dents will be converted into equity, before the next round starts.

__Interest Rate:__ It is explicitly defined in the note usually. It is usually something between 8%-12% per year which is kind of a reward to the investor, and in so many cases will be translated into discount on the financing. There is no reason to fight the vc over the interest rate, unless it's really high, like 18% or 20%.

__Warrant:__

It is a financial mechanism that both sides decide about the price of the shares in the future and fix it. It basically gives some sort of discount to the vc. Most of the time we will see either __discount__ or __warrant__ and not both.

As an entrepreneur, having discount is better because the investor gets more shares, compared to the new investors because they are getting more discount. Warrant will make the cap table harder to track.
