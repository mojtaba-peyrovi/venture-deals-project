### Venture Deals

#### Week 6: Negotiation

---

The hardest thing to do in negotiations is to look at the deal from the other side's perspective. 

Remember the average start up takes 7 to 10 years to get to an exit. This is not a transaction, it's a relationship, so learning to give each other the benefit of the doubt early will pay dividends.

Here is a very famous vc cliche:
```
You never make money on terms.
```
What is means, is that vc's are looking for upside growth of the startup, and are not investing on it because it is a great company now. Making sure that the company will have this huge upscale, is what vc's want, not to negotiate on few percent of margin at the beginning.

#### Game Theory:

It uses mathematics to understand different negotiation situations and it's so useful for entrepreneurs to learn it to deal better with business negotiations. It helps the entrepreneur to shift from emotional to rational state.

There are so many different concepts  in game theory. one of the most important one is called __The prisoners' dilemma.__

In prisoners' dilemma there are two prisoners who are potentially guilty people. Both of them are being asked whether the other person is guilty. There will be three scenarios possible:

- Scenario 1: They will remain both silent. No one rats the other one out.
- Scenario 2: One of them rats the other out and the other one stays silent.
- Scenario 3: Both of them rat the other side out.

In first case, they both get a year in jail. Second scenario, prisoner A rats out prisoner B, prisoner B gets 5 years in jail and prisoner A gets nothing. The third case, where they both rat each other out, is the worst case because they will both get 3 years in jail. 

This is one of the examples, to see which scenario works better for both sides.

Some cases, are series of multiple negotiations like company acquisition, or investment negotiations, versus some simple deals being made within one session.


`There’s a classic negotiating book from the 1980s I think called **GETTING TO YES**  and it’s a really powerful book because it was one of the first books that really
focused on negotiating in business as a way of understanding what’s going on in
the context of the business and how to get to an agreement.`

#### Walking away:

It is important for the entrepreneur to be clear and honest regarding the reason they walk away. In this way, the entrepreneur can potentially approach the vc again for future deals. It is important not to be emotional and knowing that lots of deals just don't work out.

#### Negotiation leverage:

The most powerful leverage, is to have multiple options. It's a very powerful situation to discuss simultaneously on several term sheets and try to juggle between the conditions and find the situation that works the best for you.

__IMPORTAANT:__ When it gets to negotiate with vc's it's more strategic for the entrepreneur to wait for the vc to represent a term sheet rather that the initially offer a term sheet. Because this way, the entrepreneur will get the idea of what's in the investors' mind. `it also looks so naive to propose something before even knowing if there is any interst from the investor side. So it is FALSE.`


#### Common Entrepreneur Mistakes in Negotiation:

- The biggest mistake, is to negotiate the term sheet line by line and item by item. The entrepreneur has to see the whole term sheet as a collection.

- adding a condition, because it is the market term. There is no such a thing called market term. It is so hollow to add something because our friend had this in their term sheet. Because the market terms depend on the situation, the company, and so many other conditions.

- Never ever lie. Sometimes people voluntarily say: I'm so ethical. it can mean they have done something that they try to cover. In most cases, the ethical person, just acts ethically and not mentioning it.


__Interesting:__ Delaware state in the US has a very well-defined corporate law. So, so many startups try to start there. It is really balanced and fair to both entrepreneurs and investors. If the company is located in Colorado, and the investors are in California, it's a good idea to incorporate the company in Delaware, which is a neutral territory for both sides.

#### Accredited Investors:

When we want to raise money, the investor we look for has to be accredited.

#### 83b election:

When we get the investment, there will be stock issued for us. 83b is something that locks the price of our stock, and we won't have to pay taxes for any amount higher than that.

#### 409A:
A 409A is effectively one of the many things that exist that are total employment
guarantees for accountants. The notion of a 409A is that you have to do
evaluation on your company in a certain way to value the common stock for
purposes of issuing options.
