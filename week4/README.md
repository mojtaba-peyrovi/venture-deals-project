## VENTURE DEALS
 ---

 ### Week 4:
 
 __Term sheet:__ It is something between three to 50 pages.
 
The word `term sheet` comes from the word sheet which means document, and terms, which means all the conditions that specify your cooperation with the vc firm.

 There is only two things that matter in term sheets:
 
 1) __Economics:__ Any monetary facts, such as valuation, capital, etc.
 2) __Control:__ Control is anything that allow any of the parties control something, such as who is on the board of directors, who has voting rights, etc.
 

__Price:__ One of the most important concepts in a term sheet.

##### Difference between pre-money and post-money valuation: 

When the vc says I can pay this much for your company, we should know if they mean this value is included in valuation or not, or this valuation is after the money comes of before it comes.

If the vc says I can pay 2M for 5M valuation, and it is post-money valuation, it means they want to buy 2/5 of the company. In this case, the pre-money valuation is 3M. because before the money comes it was 3M and with this 2M it will be 5M.

We can almost say that the business worth 3M, but in some cases we agree to have 10% option pool reserved from pre-money for employees. In this case the 3M would get lower by 10%.


In other words:
```
Your post-money valuation is what you get in total.
Then there would be peieces that would be taken out of it such as:
cash invested in the company, warrants, other options like option pool. 
```
The question is, how to decide to go with a company who is interested in 20% of the company, or the other one that is interested in 30% with the same amount of money? 

The answer is, it's good to have more than one investor to be leading investors in the company. If you want to have the price up as the entrepreneur, it's clever to have multiple companies to bid for the company and the price can rise.

And the other factor of course, is the progress that we made.

__NOTE:__ Be careful, not any investor that is willing to pay more, is the best investor choice for our company. There are other terms that we need to consider before choosing the investor.

In answer to the investor asking: What is the valuation do you have for your company?

we can say: `We are looking for the most fair valuation for the company and we are seeing what the market is telling us.`

It is always the investors' responsibility to offer a price not the entrepreneur.


#### Liquidation Preferences:

In a vc deal, the vc firm will put money in the company, and will own `Prefered Stock`, and it's different from the stock the entrepreneur owns, which is `common` stock. There a a number of features in the preferred stock, and the most important one, is `Liquidation Preference.` It means if the investors wants to have their money back first, or the ownership of the company.

In the example of the 2M investment, and 3M pre-money valuation and 5M post-money valuation, imagine the liquidation preference is 2M. The vc owns 40% of the company. If the company is sold for 10M, the 40% ownership will be 4M, but 2M liquidation, will remain the same. So, the vc will like the first option. In case we sell the business for only 2M, the 40% will be only 800K, but the liquidation remains 2M, so the vc prefers to get 2M, it means that the vc will get 2M and the founder gets ZERO.

In fact, liquidation preference is the way the vc tries to protect his money by getting in back first, in case of downside situation.

__Participating Preferred:__ Participating, means that the vc gets their money first, then they convert into common stocks and get their ownership. In downside case, it doesn't matter because the vc has got their money back anyway. But in upside case, it makes a big difference. In case of 10M sold, the vc gets their 2M first, then get 40% of what is left, which is 8M and they get 3.2M ownership. 

When there is preferred stock participation, anytime in the future, the company gets more investment, the ownership rises by the old vc.

__Capped participation:__ It's common in venture deals, that the participation goes on until 2X of the first investment is reached. Once the investor gets 3X return, they stop participation. There are cases, that the vc is waiting to get 3X back, and here is where the flat spot happens on the return curve. So there will be sometimes that the vc with the cap doesn't care if we sell the company for 100M, 125M or more. because they make the same 3x in any case.

__NOTE:__ If we have participation, we better to have some cap, but the best case, is not to have any participating preferred at all.

__Liquidation Event:__ it is defined clearly in the documents including the sale of the company, the sale of the majority of the company.

#### Option Pool:

It means offering some of the stock to employees at the very first stages to keep them interested in working on the project. But what if they get the ownership and quit the next day?

For reason there is an important concept that has to be used called __VESTING.__ 

It means that they have to own their stock over time. For example the company can say for the first year no one gets any ownership, then after a year, they can offer 25% of the amount, and release slowly each month, let's say the employee has to work for entire four years in order to get the whole ownership promised.

`For vc's it's best to have the Option Pool included in pre-money valuation.`

The reason, is the vc doesn't want to be diluted as soon as they join the company. They prefer the others get diluted before the vc joins.

#### Anti Dilution:

It is a mechanism that prevents the vc's share to be diluted. For example, what if the founder decides to grant some share for free to someone, then the vc's share will be diluted.

There is an option that if the vc buys the stock for 1$ each, and later figure out the owner has sold the stock for 0.5$, the vc's buying price will automatically change to 0.5$.

But also the more fair situation, is to see how many stocks have been given to someone else for cheaper. If it doesn't make a big difference in the whole investment, the vc doesn't care much.

#### Board of Directors:

The most prominent team of the company, who set strategies, recruit, network, bring experience, and help the founders run the company. 
 
In the first stage of the startup, the best idea for the startup, is to have the founder, a vc representative, and an outsider (who is not the shareholder), as the board of directors. It seems to be a good balance.


Sometimes, vc's want to bring an associate or observer, in most of cases, it won't be a good idea, unless they are so helpful.

The other advice, is to keep the board as small as possible, and only consisting people whom we love.

We better have the board on first day of starting the business.

__Protective Provisions:__ Protective provisions are the list of things, that the company can't do unless it gets the shareholders' approval. It is usually between 8-12 items. for example, you can't sell the company unless you get permission, etc. 

We have to be so careful of this setcion, and talk about it a lot. It is an area that if we don't understand or abide by, there could be lawsuit cases against us.

Make sure this agreements are made ONLY for major decisions and not every single management decision.

__Drag Along:__ It says: If you are no longer with the company, the rest of the common shareholders can vote on your stock, and portion it however way they vote. Don't forget the preferred stock holders won't be including into this contracts because they paid for the company and will stay till they get all their stock back.

__Conversion:__ It means I always have the right to convert my preferred stock to common stock. Imagine this example, if I have 2M of preferred stock, and in the future the company is sold for 100M, I can only get my 2M back, if it's not converted to common stock. 

On the first day of the company, the ratio between the preferred and common is 1:1, but when two condition happens, it can change:

1) Someone did stock split
2) Anti delusion situation

For example, if I bought the share for 1$, then later we sell the shares for 50 cents per stock, I will have the right to convert from 10% of preferred, into 20% of common.

[here](https://vimeo.com/54981784) is a good lecture, on liquidation preference.

in this lecture, there are some good tips:

(non-participating-1x-liquidation-preference.jpg) explains how the investor who paid 0.5M as the seed investment, for 20%, get to decide to convert to common or keep the 20% preferred. It shows that it depends on how much the company is sold. If it is 0.5M, the investor gets all the money. between 0.5M and 2.5M it's better to keep the preferred because the amount of preferred is more than 20% of sold price. But for any amount higher than 2.5M, the investor would rather convert to common, because the 20% of sold price will be higher than the 0.5M of the preferred.  for example if it is 5M, 20% of it would be 1M, rather than 0.5M the vc gets if they don't convert.

Here is a big conflict between the vc and the founders. For example, if the company is going to get sold for 1M, according the the chart above, the vc wouldn't care much to negotiate for 2M sale price b because they still get their 0.5M and 2M wouldn't be a good incentive for them but for the founder it will be 1.2M difference. So, the founder has a higher incentive. and it can get worse until the price gets into the point that the vc would benefit too.

Another scenario, is to have a series A investor, and they put 5M and then the order will be, series A gets their 5M first, then the seed gets 0.5M, then whatever is left, the founders will get it. The problem is, if the company is sold for 5M, the seed investor gets nothing. And they would of course hate to have another investor onboard. but it is so common that companies get rounds E, F etc. and there will be a complicated chart of stacked interest for different investors and cause conflicts. Good companies prefer to clean up the liquidity stack, before they move to the next round, because they don't want all of this interest mis-alignment to be dragged along with the company.
