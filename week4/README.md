## VENTURE DEALS
 ---

 ### Week 4:
 
 __Term sheet:__ It is something between three to 50 pages.
 
The word `term sheet` comes from the word sheet which means document, and terms, which means all the conditions that specify your cooperation with the vc firm.

 There is only two things that matter in term sheets:
 
 1) __Economics:__ Any monetary facts, such as valuation, capital, etc.
 2) __Control:__ Control is anything that allow any of the parties control something, such as who is on the board of directors, who has voting rights, etc.
 

__Price:__ One of the most important concepts in a term sheet.

##### Difference between pre-money and post-money valuation: 

When the vc says I can pay this much for your company, we should know if they mean this value is included in valuation or not, or this valuation is after the money comes of before it comes.

If the vc says I can pay 2M for 5M valuation, and it is post-money valuation, it means they want to buy 2/5 of the company. In this case, the pre-money valuation is 3M. because before the money comes it was 3M and with this 2M it will be 5M.

We can almost say that the business worth 3M, but in some cases we agree to have 10% option pool reserved from pre-money for employees. In this case the 3M would get lower by 10%.


In other words:
```
Your post-money valuation is what you get in total.
Then there would be peieces that would be taken out of it such as:
cash invested in the company, warrants, other options like option pool. 
```
The question is, how to decide to go with a company who is interested in 20% of the company, or the other one that is interested in 30% with the same amount of money? 

The answer is, it's good to have more than one investor to be leading investors in the company. If you want to have the price up as the entrepreneur, it's clever to have multiple companies to bid for the company and the price can rise.

And the other factor of course, is the progress that we made.

__NOTE:__ Be careful, not any investor that is willing to pay more, is the best investor choice for our company. There are other terms that we need to consider before choosing the investor.

In answer to the investor asking: What is the valuation do you have for your company?

we can say: `We are looking for the most fair valuation for the company and we are seeing what the market is telling us.`

It is always the investors' responsibility to offer a price not the entrepreneur.


#### Liquidation Preferences:

In a vc deal, the vc firm will put money in the company, and will own `Prefered Stock`, and it's different from the stock the entrepreneur owns, which is `common` stock. There a a number of features in the preferred stock, and the most important one, is `Liquidation Preference.` It means if the investors wants to have their money back first, or the ownership of the company.

In the example of the 2M investment, and 3M pre-money valuation and 5M post-money valuation, imagine the liquidation preference is 2M. The vc owns 40% of the company. If the company is sold for 10M, the 40% ownership will be 4M, but 2M liquidation, will remain the same. So, the vc will like the first option. In case we sell the business for only 2M, the 40% will be only 800K, but the liquidation remains 2M, so the vc prefers to get 2M, it means that the vc will get 2M and the founder gets ZERO.

In fact, liquidation preference is the way the vc tries to protect his money by getting in back first, in case of downside situation.

__Participating Preferred:__ Participating, means that the vc gets their money first, then they convert into common stocks and get their ownership. In downside case, it doesn't matter because the vc has got their money back anyway. But in upside case, it makes a big difference. In case of 10M sold, the vc gets their 2M first, then get 40% of what is left, which is 8M and they get 3.2M ownership. 

When there is preferred stock participation, anytime in the future, the company gets more investment, the ownership rises by the old vc.

__Capped participation:__ It's common in venture deals, that the participation goes on until 2X of the first investment is reached. Once the investor gets 3X return, they stop participation. There are cases, that the vc is waiting to get 3X back, and here is where the flat spot happens on the return curve. So there will be sometimes that the vc with the cap doesn't care if we sell the company for 100M, 125M or more. because they make the same 3x in any case.

__NOTE:__ If we have participation, we better to have some cap, but the best case, is not to have any participating preferred at all.

__Liquidation Event:__ it is defined clearly in the documents including the sale of the company, the sale of the majority of the company.

#### Option Pool:

It means offering some of the stock to employees at the very first stages to keep them interested in working on the project. But what if they get the ownership and quit the next day?

For reason there is an important concept that has to be used called __VESTING.__ 

It means that they have to own their stock over time. For example the company can say for the first year no one gets any ownership, then after a year, they can offer 25% of the amount, and release slowly each month, let's say the employee has to work for entire four years in order to get the whole ownership promised.

`For vc's it's best to have the Option Pool included in pre-money valuation.`

The reason, is the vc doesn't want to be diluted as soon as they join the company. They prefer the others get diluted before the vc joins.

#### Anti Dilution:

It is a mechanism that prevents the vc's share to be diluted. For example, what if the founder decides to grant some share for free to someone, then the vc's share will be diluted.

There is an option that if the vc buys the stock for 1$ each, and later figure out the owner has sold the stock for 0.5$, the vc's buying price will automatically change to 0.5$.

But also the more fair situation, is to see how many stocks have been given to someone else for cheaper. If it doesn't make a big difference in the whole investment, the vc doesn't care much.
