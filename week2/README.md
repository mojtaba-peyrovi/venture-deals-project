## VENTURE DEALS
 ---
 
 ### Week 2:
 
 __How much money we need to raise?__
 
 The amount of money we should raise, is the least amount of money we need to get to the next milestone. We need to define our major milestones. 
 
 - Never say a range of two numbers for the amount of money you need to raise. Because the vc firm will immediately chose one of them to their own benefit not us. So, we should have a specific amount for the fund raising process.
 
 #### What is our homework as an entrepreneur?
 
 The idea of having a perfect business plan in tens of pages with all the details of the future business, even before we start it, is almost obsolete. What is useful these days, is __the Planning Process.__
 
 Instead, we have to prepare two set of documents:
 
 1) __Executive Summary:__ A three to five pages document, describing what we are doing? what it matters? and where is it going?
 
 2) __A 10-20 pages of PowerPoint presentation:__ It shows how exactly the business works. It must be presentable in front of a group of people so that they could walk through with us into all the business steps.    
 
 There are two really important principles when we deal with a potential investor:

1) __Transparency:__ Be open with the future investor about what you are doing, what's going on, strengths and weaknesses.
2) __Never Ever Lie about Anything:__ The first time you lie, is the last time you get the chance to interact.

It is important not to exaggerate, but you can have aspirations and tell them your wishes.

What is important, is in the financial plan of the business, there expenses part of the project can be done in a believable and reasonable manner, but the other side, which is the revenue part is a nonsense. No one can predict it.

At the early stages the investors don't care much about the numbers. What the care the most is:
1) To see if we really know how the economics of this business works.
2) To see if the business we are presenting them, can be potentially a big business in the future or not.

Don't be delusional about your business future also. If you think you raise 1 million dollars, then in a couple of years, it will grow to 100 million of revenue and 20 million of profit, it's delusional.

### How to find the right VC, and how to close the deal?

It is like dating someone. You will feel after the first meeting that you would feel they have a lot of energy and they looked cool, and we want to meet them again.

__NOTE:__ The average time of the relationship between a vc and an entrepreneur, is longer than the average length of an America marriage.

We can talk to anyone about the company, and approach the CEO or anyone in their team and they have to be open about it.


#####Steps:

First we have to find a list of VC's that can invest in the level that our business is. Then drop them an email asking for a meeting not in a very cliche way, but have it sound more interesting. Then the vc will arrange a meeting.

__IMPORTANT:__ Try to get clear about what the vc really want and what is their decision process. Don't feel ashamed of asking them about their steps, and follow their rules in order to get a yes answer from them. Because at any stage if they feel less interested, they may reject the whole project.

##### What is Term Sheet?
```
A term sheet is a bullet-point document outlining the material terms and conditions of a business agreement. After a term sheet has been "executed", it guides legal counsel in the preparation of a proposed "final agreement".
```
(Caveat: کویات، هشدار)

Don't share your term sheets with the vc before you know them.

### Common Mistakes While Raising Money:

__NDA: (Non-disclosure agreement):__ it  is a legal contract between at least two parties that outlines confidential material, knowledge, or information that the parties wish to share with one another for certain purposes, but wish to restrict access to or by third parties.

- The mistake entrepreneurs make with NDA, is to ask the vc firm to sign it. Never do it.
- Mistakes entrepreneurs make with their __first meeting__ is in introduction phase. don't bombard them with emails. Don't do cliche. Don't call someone at the email as Dear Jim, if you are not sure the person who reads the emails, is not Jim but his partner.
- Should we use this approach of "Never take NO as an answer" and keep persisting? Nope, that slogan works well with sales, but most of the times with vc firms, no means no. But there could be some scenarios that down the road, while your business is growing you approach them again and get the yes answer. But it is so atypical in the relationship with a vc.
- If you got a NO, don't ask for a referral. Because the first question the referee is going to ask, is if they are going to invest? and when they say no, the referee can't help it much.
- Also, when you hear a NO, don't ask the vc guy if they know anyone that might be interested. Because it doesn't have any benefits for the vc.
- Usually, each company will have 1-4 investors during their life cycle.
- Being a solo founder is not a good idea in most of the cases and vc's don't trust them so much.
- Directly cold emailing the vc's won't get their attention easily. try to build connections with them. For example, try to comment on their blog posts, or become a part of their community and join their events.

#### Seed Stage investing:
Seed money, sometimes known as seed funding or seed capital, is a form of securities offering in which an investor invests capital in a startup company in exchange for an equity stake in the company. The term seed suggests that this is a very early investment, meant to support the business until it can generate cash of its own (see cash flow), or until it is ready for further investments. 

The terms we get the investment at seeds round, will usually flow through to the next level investments.

#### VC company's structure:

__GP-LP Structure:__ GP stands for general partner, and LP stands for limited partner. 

- GP consists of all the partners working together.
- LP's are investors who invest in projects.

In vc projects, both GP and LP partners invest, and it is called the __Fund.__ 

A vc can be consisting of multiple funds.

GP's will be partners and owners of another company which is called __Management company__ which is a one of the structure parts also.

LP's put most of the money. Traditionally, 99% of the money came from LP and 1% from GP. But nowadays, the GP share has raised to 2%, 3% or even more.

The fund, will pay the management company for management fees. 

The fund will invest in projects, and when the companies exit, the sold entity's money gets back into the fund and distributed to teh GP's and LP's.

#### Reverves:
Reserve is the amount of money that the vc firm reserves for future investment on companies. for example, when they alocate 5 million usd to a company, on the backstage, they may reserve 3-8 million for the future because they know that companies need money. It is so vital for vc's to manage their reserves because the mismanagement can screw companies.
