## VENTURE DEALS

 ### Week 4:
 
 __Term sheet:__ It is something between three to 50 pages.
 
The word `term sheet` comes from the word sheet which means document, and terms, which means all the conditions that specify your cooperation with the vc firm.

 There is only two things that matter in term sheets:
 
 1) __Economics:__ Any monetary facts, such as valuation, capital, etc.
 2) __Control:__ Control is anything that allow any of the parties control something, such as who is on the board of directors, who has voting rights, etc.
 

__Price:__ One of the most important concepts in a term sheet.

##### Difference between pre-money and post-money valuation: 

When the vc says I can pay this much for your company, we should know if they mean this value is included in valuation or not, or this valuation is after the money comes of before it comes.

If the vc says I can pay 2M for 5M valuation, and it is post-money valuation, it means they want to buy 2/5 of the company. In this case, the pre-money valuation is 3M. because before the money comes it was 3M and with this 2M it will be 5M.

We can almost say that the business worth 3M, but in some cases we agree to have 10% option pool reserved from pre-money for employees. In this case the 3M would get lower by 10%.


In other words:
```
Your post-money valuation is what you get in total.
Then there would be peieces that would be taken out of it such as:
cash invested in the company, warrants, other options like option pool. 
```
The question is, how to decide to go with a company who is interested in 20% of the company, or the other one that is interested in 30% with the same amount of money? 

The answer is, it's good to have more than one investor to be leading investors in the company. If you want to have the price up as the entrepreneur, it's clever to have multiple companies to bid for the company and the price can rise.

And the other factor of course, is the progress that we made.

__NOTE:__ Be careful, not any investor that is willing to pay more, is the best investor choice for our company. There are other terms that we need to consider before choosing the investor.

In answer to the investor asking: What is the valuation do you have for your company?

we can say: `We are looking for the most fair valuation for the company and we are seeing what the market is telling us.`

It is always the investors' responsibility to offer a price not the entrepreneur.
